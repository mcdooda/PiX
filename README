PiX by Nicolas DODELIER
A small ruby nonogram game.

How to run the game:
$ cd PiX/
$ ruby pix.rb

Requires (may work with later versions):
- ruby1.9.1
- libsdl-ruby1.9.1
- libopengl-ruby1.9.1

You can create your own puzzles by putting
png files into the resources/images/grids/
folder. If the image is larger than
7 pixels, the digits may be outside of the
window. The grid is computed using pixels
whose alpha channel is 255.
